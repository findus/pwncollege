#In previous levels you implemented a while loop to count the number of
#consecutive non-zero bytes in a contiguous region of memory. In this level
#you will be provided with a contiguous region of memory again and will loop
#over each performing a conditional operation till a zero byte is reached.
#All of which will be contained in a function!
#
#A function is a callable segment of code that does not destroy control flow.
#Functions use the instructions "call" and "ret".
#
#The "call" instruction pushes the memory address of the next instruction onto
#the stack and then jumps to the value stored in the first argument.
#
#Let's use the following instructions as an example:
#0x1021 mov rax, 0x400000
#0x1028 call rax
#0x102a mov [rsi], rax
#
#1. call pushes 0x102a, the address of the next instruction, onto the stack.
#2. call jumps to 0x400000, the value stored in rax.
#The "ret" instruction is the opposite of "call". ret pops the top value off of
#the stack and jumps to it.
#Let's use the following instructions and stack as an example:
#
#                            Stack ADDR  VALUE
#0x103f mov rax, rdx         RSP + 0x8   0xdeadbeef
#0x1042 ret                  RSP + 0x0   0x0000102a
#ret will jump to 0x102a
#
#Please implement the following logic:
#str_lower(src_addr):
#    i = 0
#    if src_addr != 0:
#        while [src_addr] != 0x00:
#            if [src_addr] <= 0x5a:
#                [src_addr] = foo([src_addr])
#                i += 1
#            src_addr += 1
#    return i
#
#foo is provided at 0x403000. foo takes a single argument as a value and returns a value.
#
#All functions (foo and str_lower) must follow the Linux amd64 calling convention (also known as System V AMD64 ABI):
#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#System_V_AMD64_ABI
#
#Therefore, your function str_lower should look for src_addr in rdi and place the function return in rax.
#
#An important note is that src_addr is an address in memory (where the string is located) and [src_addr] refers to the byte that exists at src_addr.
#
#Therefore, the function foo accepts a byte as its first argument and returns a byte.
#
#We will now run multiple tests on your code, here is an example run:
#- (data) [0x404000] = {10 random bytes},
#- rdi = 0x404000
